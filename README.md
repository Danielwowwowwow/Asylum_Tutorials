# Asylum Tutorials

This project is aimed to provide supplementary material for my (hungarian) articles posted on my [blog](http://darthasylum.blog.hu/).

## Compilation

You need *Visual Studio 2010* or newer to compile the samples. All external libraries are included in the repo (except the Vulkan drivers and validation layers).
Some of the samples have a prebuilt executable in the `bin` folder.

## License

The code is provided under the BSD license.
